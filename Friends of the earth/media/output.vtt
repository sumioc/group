00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
I love you so many people think about

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.430
climate change they think this couldn't

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.420
be that bad you know you might have

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.540
nicer hotter summers but the reality is

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.150
far from that we've seen forest fires

6
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.269
droughts floods melting of the ice caps

7
00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.770
those in the poorest parts of the world

8
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.600
have done least to cause the climate

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.640
crisis already feeling it's sharp impact

10
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.880
scientists are clear that we are on

11
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.220
track for three to four degrees warming

12
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.619
the kind of planet that people are set

13
00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.719
to inhabit if we carry on going the way

14
00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.520
that we are is a really really

15
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.730
unpleasant inhospitable place where many

16
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.829
people will be forced into conflict over

17
00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.989
kind of basic resources many many

18
00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.629
species will become extinct terrible

19
00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.360
floods lots more droughts parts of

20
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.460
Europe could actually become desert

21
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.899
there could be hundreds and hundreds of

22
00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.270
millions of people forced to flee their

23
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.309
homes kind of look at the news and I

24
00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.600
kind of see what the government announce

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.910
day in kind of day out and it's you know

26
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.260
it doesn't look anything like the kind

27
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.690
of solutions and that we need thankfully

28
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.700
we do actually have a small window to

29
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.860
make massive differences these next few

30
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.080
years are absolutely critical you know

31
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.460
we can do it and we know what the

32
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.439
solutions are we know that we have to

33
00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.270
have a hundred percent clean energy as

34
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.619
soon as possible we know we have to move

35
00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.780
away from fossil fuels and ban fracking

36
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.909
we have to have a massive expansion of

37
00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.590
public transport it's also exciting

38
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.390
solutions like you know doubling tree

39
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.040
cover frenzied earth wanna support

40
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.560
people taking action across the country

41
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.689
in their community we can build a

42
00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.460
movement that's so strong that we will

43
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.200
make sure our government takes action

44
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.890
there were loads of things that you can

45
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.049
do to get active you can write your MP

46
00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.580
you can get involved in a climate action

47
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.619
group take action in your community

48
00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.930
maybe join the protest talk to your

49
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.369
friends and family it's really important

50
00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.380
that more more people understand threat

51
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.909
that is climate change but collectively

52
00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.130
we have a lot of power especially if we

53
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.080
come together and organize we know what

54
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.610
the solutions are we just have to fight

55
00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.259
for them and together we can turn this

56
00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.229
crisis around yeah you should be shocked

57
00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.880
I'm really shocked actually as well

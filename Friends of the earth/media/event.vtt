00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.359
keeping wildlife thriving from beavers

to plant trees

17
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.440

the greener energy solution

22
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.360

23
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.440
players money has supported seemingly

24
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.079
impossible battles to gain traction it's

25

30
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.720

groundbreaking legislation in scotland

33
00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.479

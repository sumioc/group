          <h3>Stop The Cruise</h3>
          <img src="images/cruise.jpg" alt="cruise image" class="round" />
          <p>
            Cruise companies DUMP wastewater into our oceans and SPEW
            climate-warming emissions into our atmosphere. They do not care
            about the delicate balance of some of the worlds most sensitive
            ecosystems. They care about their profits.
          </p>
          <p>
            The EPA has allowed cruise companies to pollute our oceans and drive
            the climate crisis for too long. But YOU have a chance to help
            change that. Please do not wait another moment!
          </p>
          <p>
            We need 1,938 more signatures by midnight tonight! Demand the EPA
            regulate cruise companies before it is too late!

          <h3>Stop Selling Bee-Killing</h3>
          <img src="images/BeesAChance.png" alt="bees image" class="round" />
          <p>
            Lowe’s and Home Depot continue to sell glyphosate -- a.k.a. the
            active ingredient in Bayer-Monsanto’s Roundup® -- putting millions
            at risk from this toxic pesticide. Will you demand Lowe's and Home
            Depot put the planet before Big Ag profits?
          </p>
          <p>
            Demand Lowe’s and Home Depot remove cancer-causing Roundup® from
            store shelves!

          <h3>Plastic Crisis</h3>
          <img src="images/plastic.jpg" alt="plastic image" class="round" />
          <p>
            Plastic has already made its way into every aspect of life on Earth
            -- our food, our water, and our air.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our oceans are being decimated by plastic waste, and the plastic
            that doesn’t end up in the sea gets poured into landfills and
            incinerators, seeping into our soil and air. Animals are choking and
            dying from plastic, while humans unknowingly consume a credit card’s
            worth of plastic every week.
          </p>
          <p>
            Powerful plastic corporations and their friends in the fossil fuel
            industry are raking in massive profits while people, animals, and
            the planet suffer the devastating consequences of rampant plastic
            pollution.

          <h3>Save our public lands</h3>
          <img src="images/save-land.jpg" alt="land image" class="round" />
          <p>
            Fossil fuel destruction threatens vast glaciers in the Arctic
            National Wildlife Refuge, fragile arches in Utah, and even
            Colorado’s Dinosaur National Monument. And it wrecks wildlife
            habitat, hurting animals from polar bears to gray wolves to sage
            grouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            What’s more – we’re currently in a race against the clock to fight
            climate change. Scientists have already declared climate change a
            “code red for humanity.” Fossil fuel development on our public lands
            and waters has no place in a livable future on this planet.

          <h3>Stop Factory Farming</h3>
          <img src="images/Thismuststop.png" alt="stop image" class="round" />
          <p>
            Factory farming is one of the worst perpetrators of animal cruelty,
            air and water pollution and public health harm. But Big Meat and
            Dairy corporations spend millions lobbying each year to keep you
            from realizing just how dangerous they really are.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re fighting back, but we can’t do it without support from
            environmental activists like you – and your name is still missing
            from our petition. Please, with so much on the line, add your
            signature now to demand the United States Department of Agriculture
            stop supporting factory farming.

          <h3>PROTECTION BEES</h3>
          <img
            src="images/bee-protect.jpg"
            alt="protectbee image"
            class="round"
          />
          <p>
            Bees and other pollinators are responsible for one in every three
            bites of food we eat. They’re critical to the health and survival of
            the planet and our food system. And yet they’re facing massive
            threats from toxic pesticides produced by corporations like
            Bayer-Monsanto. We need the Environmental Protection Agency to take
            action NOW, before the destruction of our pollinators is
            irreversible! Add your name to demand the EPA take action to protect
            bees from lethal pesticides!
